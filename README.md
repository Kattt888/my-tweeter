# Tweeter Project

Welcome to Tweeter, a dynamic and responsive single-page Twitter clone designed to showcase both front-end and back-end development skills. This project demonstrates the integration of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX on the front-end, alongside Node.js and Express on the back-end. This project highlights my technical expertise while delivering a clean, user-friendly interface.
